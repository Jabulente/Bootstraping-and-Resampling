# Farm Soil Health Parameters Estimation from Samples using Resampling and Bootstrapping

## Overview

This project applies resampling and bootstrapping techniques to estimate key soil health parameters from a limited set of field samples. Soil health indicators such as pH, organic matter, nitrogen content, and moisture are essential for determining the productivity and sustainability of farm soils. In many real-world scenarios, especially in smallholder or remote farming areas, complete data collection is impractical—making statistical estimation from available samples crucial.


## Methodology

Using Python’s NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib libraries, I applied bootstrapping to estimate confidence intervals for soil health parameters collected from farm plots.

## Steps included:

1. Simulating or loading real soil sample data containing variables such as soil pH, organic matter (%), nitrogen content (mg/kg), and moisture (%).

2. Performing bootstrapping using resampling with replacement from each parameter’s sample distribution to generate thousands of sample means.

3. Calculating 95% confidence intervals for each soil parameter to infer their likely range across the entire farm or region.

4. Visualizing the bootstrap distributions and confidence intervals to interpret soil health status under statistical certainty.


This approach allows us to make population-level inferences (e.g., for entire plots or regions) from relatively small and accessible field datasets.


## Key Insights

- Bootstrapping provides robust estimates for soil parameters when full-population data isn't available.

- Confidence intervals help quantify uncertainty, giving farmers and agronomists better insight into variability.

- Useful in precision agriculture and land management planning where decisions rely on soil condition estimates.
